# Weather-Project
A personal project within a web course.

# The main functionalities
- It shows you information about the weather depending on the location selected from the button: temperature, precipitation, real feel, wind speed.
- It shows you the weather forecast for a period of 5 days.
- I have introduced a scroll up button to make navigation on the page easier.

# Demo
The project is deployed here: https://weather-cristi-petrisor.netlify.app/
